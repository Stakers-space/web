    <ul>
        <li>Effective Date: May 19th, 2025</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>At stakers.space, your privacy is important to us.</strong></p>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any personal data unless you voluntarily provide through stakers.space account. Even there, everything sensitive is client-side encrypted and thus we do not know the real data values.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how stakers.space ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you visit our website.</p>
    
    <h2 class="mt-30">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In a guest mode, we do not collect any data nor cookies for analytics purposes</strong></li>
        <li>In a registered user mode, we collect:
            <ul>
                <li><i>Email address</i> (required for account creation and login)</li>
                <li><i>Encrypted user data</i> (optional – encrypted on your device before storage)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any additional personal information unless you voluntarily submit it via your account. Most data you enter is **end-to-end encrypted** and unreadable to us.</p>
        
            <h3 class="mt-20">1.2 Encryption and Data Privacy</h3>
            <p>All user-provided data (except email) is encrypted <strong>client-side</strong>, meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is encrypted in your browser before being sent to our servers</li>
                <li>We <strong>do not store</strong> encryption keys</li>
                <li>We <strong>cannot decrypt </strong>your data – only you can</li>
                <li>If there are any data that cannot use client-side encryption on the basis of the technical functioning of the connected services, there is a note about that plus information about how we eliminate any risks of abuse. Furthmore, filling any data is optional, as well as using specified services working with these data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This ensures that even if our systems are compromised, your encrypted data remains secure.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-30">2. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We use a single <strong>technical cookie</strong> solely for authentication (to keep you logged in).</li>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use any analytics, tracking cookies, advertising pixels, or third-party trackers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-30">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To manage user accounts and logins</li>
        <li>To securely store encrypted content associated with your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your data with third parties, sell it, or use it for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-30">4. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete your account at any time, which will remove your email and all stored encrypted data from our systems.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-30">5. Hosting & Infrastructure</h2>
