    <h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-bold mb-3">Pricing</h1>
<p class="text-gray-700 my-8 max-w-3xl"><strong>Community‑first. Optimizations developed for large‑scale institutional services make the marginal cost of supporting individual validators extremely low. That allows us to keep Stakers.space accounts free for small stakers as a public good.</strong></p>


<div class="rounded-2xl border p-5 bg-emerald-50 mb-10">
<p class="text-gray-800"><strong>In short:</strong> <span class="font-semibold">Small stakers = free account</span> (a public resource enabled by our optimized systems). <span class="font-semibold">Institutions / large operators = paid</span> (operations, management, analytics, support). <span class="font-semibold">API</span> may be billed by usage for heavy workloads, including small stakers when relevant.</p>
</div>


<p class="mb-6">Stakers.space is an <a href="https://github.com/Stakers-space/Web" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">open‑source</a> platform offering practical guides, tools, and a privacy‑first dashboard for staking on networks secured by Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">Website</h2>
<p class="mb-6"><strong>Free.</strong> All public guides, matrices, and resources are available at no charge. Content is <a href="https://github.com/Stakers-space/Web" target="_blank" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">open‑source</a> and can be used for personal and educational purposes.</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">Account / Dashboard</h2>
<p class="mb-4">A client‑side encrypted dashboard to monitor validators and organize node information.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-6">
<li><strong>Individuals & small operators:</strong> <span class="text-emerald-700 font-semibold">Free</span> — the efficiency of our large‑scale systems keeps marginal costs near zero, so we can offer this as a public good.</li>
<li><strong>Institutions / large operators:</strong> <span class="font-semibold">Paid</span> — pricing based on scope (number of validators, SLAs, on‑call, reporting, custom features).</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8">Note: if there were a sudden market shift (e.g., extreme increase in underlying asset prices) and large clients exited, we may revisit free tiers to keep the service sustainable. We’ll communicate changes in advance.</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">API</h2>
<p class="mb-4">The Stakers.space API will use a credit‑based model. Credits are consumed per request or data unit to provide fair access and cost control.</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-6">
<li><strong>Light / occasional use:</strong> may be free or included with the account.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy workloads (polling, bulk analytics, enterprise integrations):</strong> billed by usage — applies to both small and large users when relevant.</li>
</ul>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">Liquid Staking via Stakers.space Vaults</h2>
<p class="mb-6">Fees are stated in each vault’s documentation/prospect. They may include protocol fees and operator fees depending on the setup.</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">Smoothing Pool</h2>
<p class="mb-6">Fee details will be published on the Smoothing Pool page when available.</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">Tailored Tools & Services for Institutions</h2>
<p class="mb-4">We deliver end‑to‑end services for institutional staking programs: node operations and management, security reviews, monitoring & alerting, research & analytics, data pipelines, and custom tooling.</p>
<p class="mb-6">Pricing is scoped by requirements (validators, uptime SLAs, compliance, reporting, integrations). Contact us at <a href="mailto:stakersspace@proton.me" class="text-emerald-700 hover:underline">stakersspace@proton.me</a>.</p>


<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-12 mb-3">FAQ</h2>
<details class="mb-3 p-4 border rounded-xl">
<summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Why is the account free for small stakers?</summary>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Because our systems are optimized for large institutional workloads, the marginal cost of adding small stakers is extremely low. That lets us provide accounts for individuals as a public good.</p>
</details>
<details class="mb-3 p-4 border rounded-xl">
<summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Could the free tier change?</summary>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Only if sustainability is at risk (for example, a market event leading to a broad institutional exit). If that ever happens, we will announce changes in advance and provide migration options.</p>
</details>
<details class="mb-3 p-4 border rounded-xl">
<summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do you charge for API usage by small users?</summary>
<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Light usage is often included. High‑volume workloads (e.g., frequent polling or analytics) may incur usage‑based fees to keep infrastructure fair and reliable for everyone.</p>
