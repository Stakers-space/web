	<h1 class="mt-60">About Stakers.space</h1>
	<p>Hey everyone! 👋</p>
	<p>I would like to introduce you to a new project I’ve started around staking - the <a href="https://stakers.space">https://stakers.space</a>. Here’s what it’s all about and why I’ve created it:</p>
	<h2>🔹 Staking Resources</h2>
	<p>Over the years of staking, I’ve gathered a lot of hands-on experience and created various scripts and materials for my own use. Now, I’m starting to share these resources with the community through the website. If you would like to look at some resources, you can check GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Stakers-space/staking-scripts" target="_blank">https://github.com/Stakers-space/staking-scripts</a>.</p>
	<h2>🔹 Guides and materials also for minority chains such as <a href="https://www.gnosis.io/" target="_blank">Gnosis</a> and others</h2>
	<p>While there’s extensive guidance for Ethereum staking, e.g. Gnosis staking resources are limited. Even though there are similarities, specific guides can really help beginners build confidence in staking on Gnosis and others. Also, for example testing Gnosis staking setups can be challenging due to limited client support for Chiado testnet.</p>
	<h2>🔹 The Goal</h2>
	<p>My goal with Stakers.space is to collect all essential information about staking in one place, making it easier for everyone to get started and stay safe. Here’s what’s currently available:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Step-by-step guides</strong> with a focus on simplicity and security, available as 1-page complete guide as well as <a href="/clients">client-specific guides</a>. Check out an example of 1-page guide for <a href="/ethereum-staking/full-guide">Ethereum</a> and <a href="/gnosis-staking/full-guide">Gnosis</a>.</li>
		<li><strong>Guides for multi-chain setups</strong> (e.g., Ethereum + Gnosis) <strong>and multi-service configurations</strong> (e.g., Solo Staking + StakeWise + Rocketpool) on a single node.</li>
		<li><strong>Overview of compatible clients</strong> for <a href="/ethereum-staking/clients">Ethereum</a> and <a href="/gnosis-staking/clients">Gnosis staking</a></li>
		<li><strong>Emergency procedures</strong> to troubleshoot issues as they arise.</li>
		<li><strong>Client-based encrypted Account section</strong> for monitoring staking and securely storing server settings: <a href="/account">https://stakers.space/account</a></li>
		<li><strong>Automated scripts and instructions</strong> to address common issues.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>🔹 Open Source and Offline Availability</h2>
	<p>The project is designed to ensure that all key informational content is independent of a database structure. This means anyone will have an option to download the entire website as an open-source package and access all guides locally. This setup ensures that the guides remain accessible to anyone, even if something were to happen to the website.</p>
	<h2>⚠️ Project Status</h2>
	<p>This project is still in beta, so it’s a work in progress. I’m continuously working to improve the UX, simplify the design, and add new tools and resources that will make Gnosis staking even more accessible. Also, I need to review the text and correct errors.</p>
	<p class="mt-20">Thanks for checking it out, and I’m looking forward to any feedback or questions you might have!</p>
